# Ideal Anytime Performance Model (IAPM)

In this repository lies a library for computing a theoretical model of ideal
anytime performance for algorithms that find at each iteration a solution to a
bi-objective problem. This model was first described in:

A. D. Jesus, L. Paquete, A. Liefooghe. **A model of anytime algorithm performance
for bi-objective optimization.** Journal of Global Optimization 78, 329â€“350,
2021. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10898-020-00909-9)
